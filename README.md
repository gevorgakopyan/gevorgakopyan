#### About me
  I am a rising senior at UCLA with a genuine passion for software engineering and technology. Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in a diverse range of computer science topics, ensuring a broad yet profound understanding of the field. Through my internship experiences, I have had the opportunity to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions, working collaboratively in fast-paced environments.
